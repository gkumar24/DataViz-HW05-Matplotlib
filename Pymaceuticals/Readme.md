# Home Work Assignment - Matplotlib - Final Report

## Assignment Scope

* Analyzing 4 skin cancer treatment drugs (apomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo), based on the data from treatment responses on animals, specificaly mouse.
* Create plot to show Tumor volume changes over time, for each of the treatments. 
* Create plot to show Metastatic Sits spread over time, for each of the treatments.
* Create plot to show the survival of the mouse ove the treatment over the treatment period.
* Create a Bar chart to show the percentage change in Tumor Volume over the treatment period.
* Three observation for the above data analysis

## Synonyms
* Tumor: A tumor is a mass of tissue that's formed by an accumulation of abnormal cells.
* Cancer: A disease in which abnormal cells divide uncontrollably and destroy body tissue.
* Metastasis: In metastasis, cancer cells break away from where they first formed (primary cancer), travel through the blood or lymph system, and form new tumors (metastatic tumors) in other parts of the body.

### 1. Tumor Response to Treatment
* Plot on change in Tumor Volume during the treatment period, for each of the four drugs under study.
* reduction in Tumor Volume can be correlated to the effectiveness of the Drug.

### 2. Metastatic Response to Treatment
* Plot on spread of Cancer Cells (Metastatic Sites) during the treatment period, for each of the four drugs under study. 
* reduction in spread can be correlated to the effectiveness of the Drug.

### 3. Survival Rate During Treatment
* Plot on percentage of mouse Survived during the treatment period, for each of the four drugs under study. 
* The death of mouse can be attributed to the drug or to cancer. in general high survival rate means, less side effect of the drug.

### 4. Summary of chaneg in Tumor Volume
* Change in Tumor Volume during the treatment period, for each of the four drugs under study. reduction in Tumor Volume can be correlated to the effectiveness of the Drug.

## Observation
Based on the data Analysis, below are the observation / findings. 
* The drug "Capomulin" shows effectiveness in reducing the tumor growth, in the 45 day period, the mouse has shown significant reduction in the tumor volume.
* Tumor volume show little to no effect on the drugs "Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo".
* The drug Capomulin shows effectiveness in reducing the spread of metastasis cancer cells.
